    Windows 95 b over an allready existing Windows 95a</b>

    </font>
    <p>
      Start the installation of Win95b from the CD or only copy the \win95 subfolder on
      onto your harddrive and start from there. When the licence agreement screen comes
      up do NOT press Yes, instead press Ctrl+Esc to switch to the start menu. Go to
      Run... and start notepad. With notepad open the file <b>setuppp.ini</b> in the new
      folder <b>c:\wininst4.000</b>. Search in setuppp.ini for the string [data] and
      write directly into the next line <b>OEMUP=1</b>. This section should now look like
      this:
      <br>
    </p>
<pre>
[data]
EMUP=1
</pre>
    <p>
      Save the file, close notepad, go back to the licence agreement and press Yes. The
      installation of Win95b over Win95a should work fine now.
      <br>
       During this update Win95b imports your old settings so that you don't have to fear
      to loose your custumized setup. The only experience I made is that Windoz looses
      the information about the modem.

    <p>
      open the Explorer and change to c:\windows\inf . Look for the file modem.inf ,
      right click on it and select install. (Or look on the webpage of the modem
      manufactor for a specific *.inf file. The file for my Compaq moden for example is

    Cookies in Netscape</b>
    <br>
    </font>
    <p>
      If you don't like cookies which are normaly automaticly written on your HD when you
      surf the web there is an easy way to prevent this without using any additional
      programs.
      <br>
       Simply search on your disk for the file named "cookies.txt" and delete this file.
      Then create in the same folder a subfolder with the name "cookies.txt". Next time a
      cookie is coming windows will prevent it from being written because the folder
      "cookies.txt" has a higher priority than a file named "cookies.txt".
      <br>
       Most browsers allow you to switch of cookies but will lanche a screen asking you
      if you want to accept an incoming cookie. Using the described method you can switch
      on cookies in your browser, get no nag screens and prevent them from writing stuff
      on your HD.

    <br>
    </font>
    <p>
      When you start Windows Explorer you can see only the contence of drive C: at the
      left panel. To start the Explorer with no drive directory expended you have to
      change the properties of the shortcut you use to start the Explorer. Richt click
      the shortcut or hold the [Alt] key and double click on the shortcut to go to
      Properties. Select the Shortcut Tab and at the Target text box type after the /e
      switch the /select switch, so that it looks like this:
    </p>
<pre>
 C:\WINDOWS\EXPLORER.EXE /n,/e, /select, C:\
</pre>
    <p>
      Click OK and that was it! Now when you open Windows Explorer using this shortcut
      you will see all the drives in left panel and the drive C: will be selected but not
      expanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also adjust your shortcuts to Explorer by changing the TARGET field to read
      :
    </p>
<pre>
 C:\WINDOWS\EXPLORER.EXE
/e,/n,::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}
</pre>
    <p>
      (Instead of copying that out by hand, just drag your mouse over it now,
      right-click, select COPY... and then paste it into the TARGET field later
      (right-click, then PASTE).)
      <br>
       You can also achieve the same result by right-clicking on "My Computer" and
      selecting Explore OR by holding SHIFT while double-clicking "My Computer" but the
      above methods yield a one-handed, no-keypress solution.

      You can have a reasonable performance gain by separating the system drive (C:) from
      the swap file on drive (d:) which is physically different. A small drive,
      200-300MB, can be had for a cheap price today and can be designated as both the
      Windows swap drive and (internet) temp files drive. So the HDD heads are not
      constantly moving from program files to swap/temp files.
