    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Description and Variation</u>:<b> </b>Giant hogweed is a
    member of the parsley or carrot family, Apiaceae (Umbelliferae). As its name indicates, it
    is characterized by its size and may grow 15 to 20 feet tall. Except for size, it closely
    resembles cow parsnip, <em>Heracleum lanatum</em>, a plant native to Washington. It is
    further distinguished by a stout, dark reddish-purple stem and spotted leaf stalks. Stalks
    and stems produce sturdy pustulate bristles. The stem and stalks are hollow. Stems vary
    from two to four inches in diameter. The compound leaves of giant hogweed may expand to
    five feet in breadth. Each leaflet is deeply incised. Giant hogweed is a perennial with
    tuberous root stalks which form perennating buds each year. The inflorescence is a broad
    flat-topped umbel composed of many small white florets. Each inflorescence may attain a
    diameter of two and a half feet. The florets produce large elliptic dry fruits marked with
    brown swollen resin canals up to one mm in diameter.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Economic Importance</u>:<b> &nbsp; </b>Giant hogweed has been<small><img align="right" alt="Giant hogweed plant" src="giant_ho.jpg" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="254"></small> introduced to Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United
    States as a garden curiosity. Because of its tenacious and invasive nature it soon becomes
    a pest within the ornamental garden and readily escapes. It has naturalized in many of the
    places where it was first introduced. Growing along streams in Ontario, on Vancouver
    Island, and in Great Britain it forms a dense canopy outcompeting native riparian species
    and results in an increase in soil erosion along the stream banks where it occurs. The
    plant exudes a clear watery sap which sensitizes the skin to ultraviolet radiation. This
    can result in severe burns to the affected areas resulting in severe blistering and
    painful dermatitis. These blisters can develop into purplish or blackened scars.
    Proliferating populations in urban and suburban areas represents an increasing public
    health hazard.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#10609A">Giant hogweed is currently on the federal noxious
    weed list. It is listed as a Class A weed on the Washingon State Noxious Weed List. Its
    placement on these lists were due to its potential menace as a public health hazard. The
    number and size of populations in the Seattle area, where it has been observed over the
    past four years, continue to grow annually. Literature reviewed indicates it naturalizes
    readily once it escapes from ornamental gardens where it is often cultivated as a garden
    curiosity. Populations throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, Ontario, Vancouver Island,
    and in New York State are all thought to have gotten their start in this manner. Once
    established it crowds out other native plant species and increases soil erosion along
    stream banks. Giant hogweed is a tenacious perennial which is difficult to eradicate.
    Targeting all known populations for control will prevent the further spread of giant
    hogweed in Washington. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Geographic Distribution</u>: <b>&nbsp;<img src="gianthog.jpg" alt="giant hogweed plants" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="355" HEIGHT="193"> </b>Giant hogweed is native to the Caucasus mountains
    and southwestern Asia. It has been introduced to the European continent, the United
    Kingdom, Ontario, Vancouver Island (Canada), and New York State as a garden ornamental.
    From these initial sites of introduction it has escaped and naturalized. In Washington it
    has been reported from Thurston, Kitsap, Mason, King, Island, and Clark counties. Escaped
    populations in the Seattle area are known from Lake Washington Boulevard, West Seattle,
    and the Wallingford area. Individuals have recently been noted along Interstate 5 in
    Seattle and Rainier Avenue south near Renton.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Habitat</u>:<b>&nbsp; </b>Giant hogweed may colonize a wide
    variety of habitats but is most common along roadsides, other rights-of-way, vacant lots,
    streams, and rivers. Because giant hogweed often grows in wet areas, we are considering it
    to be an invasive freshwater weed.</font></p>
    <u><p align="justify"><font color="#10609A">History</u>:<strong> &nbsp;</strong>Personal
    communication between J.K. Morton and C. Leo Hitchcock indicates Hitchcock knew of at
    least one population in the Seattle area during the early 1950's. This would be the
    earliest documented record of this species in Washington.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Growth, Development, and Reproduction</u>:<b>&nbsp; </b>Giant
    hogweed is a perennial which takes several years from germination to produce the first
    flowering stalk. It is believed to be monocarpic, dying after first flowering and seed
    set. Individual plants however, may produce additional crowns which continue to flower and
    set seed. Seed longevity is known to be greater than seven years.<small> </small>Reproduction
    is through seed and perennating buds formed on the crown and tuberous root stalk. Abundant
    seed production, a persistent root stalk, and vegetative reproduction from perennating
    buds are cited as reasons for its capability to colonize rapidly and expand populations.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Response to Herbicides</u>:<b> &nbsp; </b>2,4-D, TBA, MCPA and
    dicamba will kill above ground parts but are reportedly not particularly effective on
    persistent rootstalks. Glyphosate is considered the most effective herbicide and should be
    used cautiously around desirable species since it is nonselective. Application during bud
    stage and while the plant is actively growing is recommended by New York Cooperative
    Extension. In Great Britain, Wright recommends application during the early growing stages
    (late March to early April). In wet areas, Rodeo® (glyphosate)is the only herbicide
    permitted for use in Washington.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Response to Cultural Methods</u>:<b> &nbsp; </b>Plants may be
    dug-out, but care should be taken to remove much of the root stalk. This can be difficult
    and unpleasant. Always wear protective clothing and avoid getting the sap on your skin.
    Mowing serves only to stimulate budding on the perennating root stalk, but might be
    successful if done consistently and persistently enough to starve the rootstalk.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#10609A"><u>Biocontrol Potential</u>:<b> &nbsp; </b>Cattle and pigs are
    cited as possible biocontrol agents. Both eat giant hogweed without apparent harm.
    Trampling also damages the plant. Whether any formal investigation for phytophagous
    insects in giant hogweed's native range has been conducted is unknown.</font></p>
    <u><p align="justify"><font color="#10609A">Notes</u><strong><big>: </big></strong>Giant
    hogweed, <em>Heracleum mantegazzianum</em>, is on the federal noxious weed list.
    Introduction through imports into the United States is illegal; interstate and intrastate
    movement of this species is illegal. Russel Hahn, Weed Scientist, Cornell University,
    3-7-90, 607-255-1759, (personal communication) noted giant hogweed is an escaped
    ornamental in New York state where it is found along roadsides and in vacant lots. The
    spread of this plant appears to be slow but steady. Concern in New York centers around the
    ability of this plant to cause photodermatitis in people. Children are particularly prone
    because of its occurrence in vacant lots and its use as a make-shift weapon. Glyphosate
    and dicamba are effective according to Dr. Hahn.</font></p>
