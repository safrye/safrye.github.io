HERACLEUM MANTEGAZZIANUM Sommier & Levier       Giant hogweed, Golpar
 
Family Apiaceae
 
DIAGNOSTIC CHARACTERISTICS;  A biennial or perennial herb, up to 5 m tall;
with a taproot or fascicled fibrous root; STEMS hollow; LEAVES compound with
3 leaflets, lower ones to 2.5m long; INFLORESCENCE, loose compound umbels;
FLOWERS small, perfect; FRUIT  a schizocarp (splitting between the carpels)
into two 1-seeded sections (meicarps); the MERICARPS are elliptical, 7-12 mm
long, 6-10 mm broad, with brown oil tubes (vittae) conspicuously expanded at
their lower ends (up to 1 mm wide).
 
BASIS AS A FEDERAL NOXIUS WEED:  Causes large painful skin blisters
with eruptions on humans (Anonymous, 1981a).
 
HABITAT: It grow in areas of human inhabitation such as uncultivated or waste
lands, near houses, along railroads, roads and streams (anonymous, 1980b).
 
World Distribution:  Australia, Austria, Czechoslovkia, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, former Soviet Union,
Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States (New York, Vermont,
Washington state).
 
PLANT PARTS LIKELY TO BE INTERCEPTED:  The mericarps or whole fruits
 
SUGGESTED AVENUES OF ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES:  As an ornamental; as
a spice; baggage; seeds; foodstuffs.
 
NOTES:  Giant hogweed sap causes a skin reaction known as photo-dermatitis or
photo-sensitivity.  Exposure to the sap sensitizes the skin to sunlight and
results in swelling, blisters and eruptions of affected sites (Drever and
Hunter, 1970; Westbrooks and Preacher, 1986).  The active principles are
furocoumarins (Clarke, 1975).  In the 1970's, many cases of poisioning were
seen in Great Britain where children played with the hollow stems of the plant
as pea-shooters or telescopes (Anonymous, 1980b).  The plant is easily
recognized because of its large stature and enormous leaves (Anonymous, 1981b).
One way the plant may be spread is by consumption of the fruits or mericarps
by birds (Anonymous, 1981b).
 
The dried fruits of the plant are used as a spice in Iranian cooking and
are thus frequently intercepted by PPQ Officers during border clearance of
passengers entering the U.S. from that region.  In April, 1989, while
conducting compliance agreement checks at ethnic food stores in Los Angles,
California Medfly regulatory Inspector John Keck discovered large quantities
of HERACLEUM spp. (probably H. MANTEGAZZIANUM) for sale.  Invoices from their
supplier (Shoosh International, Inc., San Fransico) indicated the materials
had been imported under the Farsi colloqual name of "golpar."  The importer
cooperated in recalling and destroying the materials by providing a list of
all the stores that had received them.
 
Samples of the seeds tested at the APHIS Noxious Weed Containment
Facility (Whiteville Plant Methods Center, Whiteville, North Carolina)
were found to have a viability rate of 35%.
